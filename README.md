# Train-Reservation-System

The Train Ticket Reservation and Management System is a console-based application designed to simulate the reservation and management of railway tickets. It provides users with a convenient interface to perform various operations, including ticket reservation, schedule display, print tickets, cancellation, user authentication, and account management.

## Key Features:

- Ticket Reservation: Users can reserve tickets for their desired train journeys by providing necessary details such as source, destination, date, and passenger information. The system ensures the availability of seats and generates a unique ticket ID for each reservation.

- Schedule Display: The system allows users to view the schedule of available trains, including departure and arrival times, train numbers, and seat availability.

- Cancellation: Users have the option to cancel their reserved tickets if their plans change. 

- User Authentication: To ensure secure access, the system incorporates user authentication mechanisms. Users can create an account, log in using their credentials, and access personalized features like viewing past reservations and managing account information.

- Account Management: The system enables users to create and manage their accounts, including updating personal information, changing passwords, and retrieving forgotten passwords through a secure verification process.

- Interactive Interface: The application offers a menu-driven interface, guiding users through the available options and providing clear instructions for each operation. It employs user-friendly prompts and input validation to ensure a seamless user experience.

- The project follows functional programming paradigm with C language constraints like functions, pointers, arrays, strings, structures, onditional statements, Loops, I/O, memory Management, file systems, header files etc.
